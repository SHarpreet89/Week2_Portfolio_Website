# Harpreet Singh WebDevelopment Portfolio

## Description

This project involved setting up a webdevelopment portfolio for myself. The primary goal was to present my work in a clean and concise manner. 

## User Story

As a BootCamp Student, I wanted to make sure my website was developed using industry best practices , would adhere to accessibility standards and was reactive to different device sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The first screen presents an Image of myself , along with a brief introduction about myself and 
- links that connect to sections about me, my work, my resume and how to contact me.
- When the navigation links are clicked, the UI scrolls to the corresponding sections.
- When the link is clicked to my work, the first application is displayed larger in size than the others.
- When the image of a Website it clicked, you are taken to that website.
- Resizing the website for different screen sizes, the layout adapts for them precisely.
- All images include alt text, improving accessibility for screen readers.
